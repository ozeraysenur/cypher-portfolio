# 🧠 Cypher Portfolio – Neo4j Graph Projects with Explanations

This repository includes my documented Cypher & Neo4j projects.  
Each file is an assignment that includes step-by-step Cypher queries, graph modeling, screenshots, and reflections. I focused on learning-by-explaining throughout these documents.
